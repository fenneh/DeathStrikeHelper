## How It Works

### Star Rating System

The star rating (1-5 stars) is calculated based on:

1. **Healing Efficiency** (Up to 2 bonus stars)
   - +2 stars: Over 80% healing efficiency
   - +1 star: Over 60% healing efficiency
   - +0 stars: Below 60% healing efficiency

2. **Timing** (Up to 2 bonus stars)
   - +2 stars: Used at optimal Runic Power (80+ RP) or during emergency
   - +1 star: Used with adequate resources (40+ RP)
   - +0 stars: Used with poor timing

Star colors indicate rating:
- ‚≠ê Red (Poor)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Orange (Fair)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Yellow (Good)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Light Green (Very Good)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Green (Excellent)

### Timing Recommendations

The addon shows:
- ‚ûï Green plus when optimal to use (80+ RP or health below 50% with 40+ RP)
- ‚ûñ Red minus when conditions aren't ideal
- Cooldown timer after recent Death Strike use
