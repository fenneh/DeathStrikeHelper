## How It Works

### Star Rating System

The star rating (1-5 stars) is calculated based on:

1. **Healing Efficiency** (Up to 2 bonus stars)
   - +2 stars: Over 80% healing efficiency
   - +1 star: Over 60% healing efficiency
   - +0 stars: Below 60% healing efficiency

2. **Timing** (Up to 2 bonus stars)
   - +2 stars: Used at optimal Runic Power (80+ RP) or during emergency
   - +1 star: Used with adequate resources (40+ RP)
   - +0 stars: Used with poor timing

Star colors indicate rating:
- ‚≠ê Red (Poor)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Orange (Fair)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Yellow (Good)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Light Green (Very Good)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Green (Excellent)

### Timing Recommendations

The addon shows:
- ‚ûï Green plus when optimal to use (80+ RP or health below 50% with 40+ RP)
- ‚ûñ Red minus when conditions aren't ideal
- Standard WoW cooldown timer and swipe animation after recent Death Strike use
- The built-in cooldown text shows tenths of seconds when under 1 second

### Sound Alert Conditions

Sound alerts can be configured to play for any of these conditions:
- **High Runic Power Cap** - When RP is at or above 105
- **High Runic Power** - When RP is at or above 80
- **Low Health** - When health is below 50% and RP is at least 40

Sounds only play during combat to prevent unnecessary alerts.

### Critical Health Override

When your health drops below 30% and you have at least 40 Runic Power, the addon will:
- Override the normal 5-second cooldown (after just 1 second)
- Recommend using Death Strike immediately
- Play the Low Health sound alert
- Show "Critical HP" in debug output
- Display a configurable text overlay ("SLAM IT" by default) on the Death Strike icon

This helps ensure you can spam Death Strike when in danger, rather than waiting for the full cooldown.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode with `/dsh debug` to see detailed information in your chat window:
- Current health percentage and runic power
- Which conditions are being met
- When sounds are being played or suppressed
- Cooldown status and overrides
